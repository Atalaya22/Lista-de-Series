# ListaSeries

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## API + PostgreSQL

This project includes a local API in `server/index.js` for persisting entries in PostgreSQL.

1. Copy envs:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start API server:

```bash
npm run start:api
```

3. In another terminal, start Angular:

```bash
npm start
```

Default DB values in `.env.example` are:
- `PGHOST=localhost`
- `PGPORT=8080`
- `PGUSER=admin`
- `PGPASSWORD=admin`
- `PGDATABASE=postgres`

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
